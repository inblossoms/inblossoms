- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently trying to develop a plugin to enhance the editing capabilities of VSCode.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning the underlying implementations of some popular warehouses and getting involved with them.
- ðŸ‘¯ I want to have some programming partners who fit well. You can reach me at [JUEJIN](https://juejin.cn/user/1218688825432605).
- âš¡ Fun fact: I try to make it fun.
